                <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Joseph Baya Kwicha</strong>, a passionate software engineer and developer from Kilifi County, Kenya. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in computer science at Laikipia University.</p>
                <p>With a strong background in graphic design and a keen eye for aesthetics, I love combining design and functionality in my projects. I enjoy working with various technologies and continuously expanding my skill set.</p>
                <p><strong>Those who've known me will always give you the information below :</strong></p>
                <p>He was born in the year 2003 in small village in Kenya called Bomani at Magarini sub-county. 
                    <br>He is the son of a great business man known as Samuel Kwicha Baya whose success in business has played a tremendous role in influencing Joseph to be who he is. <br>
                    His kind mother Margaret Zawadi Mwaringa is not only a mother but also a teacher to Joseph. Joseph learnt a lot of vertues including  hardworking, accountability in responsibilities and time management from his mother.  
                 <br><p>Joseph grew up in Malindi, where he studied at Kabiboni Primary after where he went to a certain National school called <strong>Friends School Kamusinga</strong> in Kimilili,Bungoma County. His exemplary academic perfomance guaranteed him to persue the <span style="color: rgb(212, 0, 255);">Computer Science Degree</span> currently at Laikipia University.</p>
                 Joseph's personality is based on his prowess in being an all rounder.Of course he's emotionally, physically and spiritually fit. This is substantiated by not only his strong background in Christianity as his religion( member of <a href="https://mrfpc.org">mrfpc</a> church) but also the fact that he's been a footballer playing for the school teams ever since.
